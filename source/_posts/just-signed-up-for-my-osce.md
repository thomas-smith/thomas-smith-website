It’s the 18th of May 2017 and just over a month since I completed my OSCP. I have decided to take things further with my career progression and signed up for the [OSCE](https://www.offensive-security.com/information-security-certifications/osce-offensive-security-certified-expert/) course by [Offensive Security](https://www.offensive-security.com/).

### Why?
You may be asking yourself why I have decided to take the Cracking the Perimeter (OSCE) course. Well, after starting the OSCP without any prior experience to penetration testing, I found the course to be fantastic and a credit to Offensive Security. OSCP not only showed me how to do a penetration test, it showed me so much more. It showed me that no matter the difficulties encountered, if you have the determination and can do attitude you will succeed. The Offensive Security mantra TRY HARDER definitely comes to play in the OSCP and I believe it will continue throughout OSCE.

So as you can probably tell, courses from Offensive Security are hard and they are hard for a reason. They teach you that if you want become good at something, you need to suffer and keep up the Offensive Security mantra of TRY HARDER. This is why I have decided to take the Cracking the Perimeter (OSCE) course. I know its going to be hard, I know I am going to cry, and I know that I will have to TRY HARDER…..but I will succeed.
