Hey, as you can probably tell from the title of the website I am Thomas and I am a Security Penetration Tester, but thats not all. I am also a software engineer specialising in Ruby, NodeJS, Elixir and Python with a number of front end technologies such as ReactJS, Javascript and the usual HTML and CSS.

I have a number of years experience doing Software engineering but over the years I have had an interest in security and hacking so I decided back in November 2016 to study towards my [OSCP](https://www.offensive-security.com/information-security-certifications/oscp-offensive-security-certified-professional/) for which I passed my OSCP in April of this year 2017.

I continue to develop my experience and knowledge through dong CTF and working through various [VulnHub](https://www.vulnhub.com/) machines.
